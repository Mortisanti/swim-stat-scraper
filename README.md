# Purpose
This is a project that I was assigned during a job interview in early 2024. I succeeded in finishing the project, and it received approval from the hiring manager. In summary, its goal is to automatically scrape swimmers' best time results from [SwimStandards](https://swimstandards.com/) using provided URLs, store the scraped data in a database, generate a PDF using said data, and emailing the PDF to a provided recipient address every morning.

# Assignment Requirements
1. Fetch swimming best times for individual swimmer(s), nightly
2. Store in database such that it can be queried later
3. Generate PDF report summarizing prior dayâ€™s information
4. Email PDF report (attached, not linked) by the following morning
5. Utilize one backend API call to accomplish the task, e.g. Google API for email

# Usage
1. Follow the steps from Google's [Python quickstart page](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python) for authentication and authorization
   * Include `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send` as one of the scopes in the quickstart.py file
2. Modify the **SWIMMERS** list variable in [constants.py](/constants.py)
   * Each element in the list is a dictionary able to contain the birthdate and SwimStandards URL for an individual swimmer
   * The birthdate format does not matter
   * Example URL: `https://swimstandards.com/swimmer/rylee-erisman`
   * As expected, more than one swimmer can be added to the list
3. Modify the **SENDER_EMAIL** and **RECIPIENT_EMAIL** variables in [constants.py](/constants.py)
4. Run [main.py](/main.py)
5. Automate using a cron job, Windows Task Scheduler, etc. to run [main.py](/main.py) daily
